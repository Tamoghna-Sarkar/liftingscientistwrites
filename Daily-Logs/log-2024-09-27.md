# Daily Log - 27th September 2024

* Another morning which started late but as always started with MAA BABA, chores, and off to OHs for my UG class where I resolved some problems and could not resolve some on the spot, so took it for later. Eventually got 35mins delayed which is unaccounted payment for TAs(updated the prof about because from now I want to keep a check on how much is really going into TAship stuff).
* Structured my GitHub journal. Integrated markdown for faster content management.
* Went to the Gym for some light deficit deadlifts and accessories.
* Booked my tickets for CCU via DEL and yet again a crazy layover at Tokyo this time.
    - Constraints: Budget, my course exam ends on 16th which is very pre-Christmas and its mad how the airline companies take advantage of people by shooting prices up knowing people want to go back home to family in the winter. How much more will capitalism churn?
        + Will Runaway Inequality never end?
        + Kalki has to land sooner than planned.
* Did Quick laundry.
* Took some time to visit Mangu on the way.
* Messed my meal plans for the day.
    - Had to head to PExp for quick and junk protien, hahaha.
* Renovation work after 26years at home. It is finally happening. God's plan.
* Ended the day after a conversation with Baba about Tripura tickets and how he understands my trajectories and supports it.
* Checked up on Maa about her taking her meals on time, some wash basin fitting issues. Resolved later.
* OK bye, peace, Pahimam Pahimam Satguru, Apne Apne Mata-Pita ki Jay, Samasta Loka Sukhinau Bhavantu, Om TaT Sat, Kripa karo _/\_
