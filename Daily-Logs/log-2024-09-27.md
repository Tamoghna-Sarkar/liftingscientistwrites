# Daily Log - 27th September 2024

* The morning arrived later than planned, yet it began, as always, with the calming presence of MAA and BABA, grounding me for the day ahead. Some things never change, and perhaps, that's where we find our balance amidst the chaos of life. Off to office hours for my UG class, where I resolved some technical issues for the students. However, a few problems remained unresolved—learning, like life, is a continuous process. I left the session 35 minutes behind schedule. Unpaid time, yet another reminder to track the invisible hours spent in TAship. As Rumi once said, *“You are not a drop in the ocean, you are the entire ocean in a drop.”* Every effort, no matter how small, contributes to the whole.
  
* Structured my GitHub journal—decided to switch to markdown for faster content management. The process felt like organizing thoughts into neat, tangible compartments, a small victory in the ever-expanding digital world.

* Headed to the gym for some light deficit deadlifts. There’s something about lifting weights that mirrors life—lifting what's heavy, only to become stronger in the process. As the iron bends to my will, I remember that the heaviest burdens are often the ones we can’t see.

* I booked my tickets to CCU via DEL, only to face yet another layover—this time in Tokyo. Life, it seems, loves testing patience. The constraints of a tight budget and my course exam ending on the 16th—just before the madness of Christmas travel—left few options. Airlines, ever the opportunists, hike prices, knowing how much people value homecomings. Capitalism churns endlessly, doesn’t it? But as Kabir said, *“Dhan ka lobh bada paapi hai, khol de apni mutthi, varna haath khali reh jayenge.”* (The greed for wealth is sinful; open your hand, or it will remain empty).

    - Will runaway inequality ever find its limits?  
    - Kalki, the harbinger of transformation, seems to be running behind schedule. We await balance.

* Quick laundry to reset my space—there's something metaphorical about cleaning the external to declutter the internal. Every rinse, a renewal.

* Visited Mangu on the way—brief, but important. Sometimes, a simple conversation with someone grounded is all it takes to reset your perspective.

* Meal plans were a bit chaotic today. Life intervened, and I found myself at PExp, grabbing some quick, albeit junk, protein. Perhaps it’s a lesson in adapting—when plans crumble, you go with the flow, not against it.

* The renovation work at home—after 26 long years—is finally happening. Brick by brick, the house transforms, and with it, so does our sense of belonging. It’s a reminder that everything has its time, as divine plans unfold beyond our control. As they say, *“Jab tak uski raza nahi, patta bhi nahi hilta.”* (Until it is God's will, not even a leaf stirs).

* Concluded the day with a conversation with Baba about the Tripura tickets. He understands my trajectories, my wanderings, and in that understanding, I find peace. There’s a quiet beauty in having your steps witnessed, even from afar.

* Checked on Maa to ensure she’s taking her meals on time. A minor wash basin fitting issue was resolved. The smallest details often carry the most weight, don’t they? In caring for the details, we nurture the whole.

* And so, I end the day with gratitude. *Pahimam Pahimam Satguru*, the journey continues under the grace of those who guide us. *Apne Apne Mata-Pita ki Jay*, for in them, we find our roots. May all beings be happy. *Om TaT Sat*. Let the divine grace flow, as we walk these paths. _/\_
