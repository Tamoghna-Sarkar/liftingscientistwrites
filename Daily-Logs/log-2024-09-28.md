# Daily Log - 28th September 2024

Today started with a lingering thought, one that had been quietly creeping into my consciousness:

*Is it like, just like code, algorithms, and many other constructs, that hierarchical ordering is important for balance in human society?*

If so, why does this hierarchy seem to tilt so sharply, with the majority of people languishing in the lower tiers while only a select few enjoy the privileges at the top?

- When we write code, the structure is paramount—there’s an order, a clear delineation of how functions, classes, and modules interact with one another.
    - Every layer has its purpose, its function, and the system thrives when balance is maintained.
    - When one part of the system overreaches or underperforms, the program becomes inefficient or crashes altogether.
  
- The same principle appears in nature: ecosystems are delicate balances of hierarchy, where every organism has a role.
    - From apex predators to the tiniest microbes, there’s an invisible code that keeps the system alive.
    - And yet, in human society, this balance seems to fray at the edges.
    - The hierarchy is skewed, leaving vast majorities at the bottom, working tirelessly to support those perched at the top.

    > Is this really a balance, or is it a distortion of the natural order?

*This imbalance poses a critical question:*

- *Why does the lower tier remain so large, and how does this skewed distribution sustain itself over time?*
    - Is it by design, or is it a failure of collective will?

When I reflect on how algorithms operate, how data structures ensure efficiency, I wonder if a similar model could apply to societal structures.
- But algorithms work because they are built to be optimized—they follow rules and are engineered for a purpose.
- In contrast, human hierarchies often seem less purposeful and more driven by ambition, greed, or perhaps simply by inertia.

Take capitalism as a code, for instance. 
- The top tier grows exponentially, feeding on resources and labor from the lower tiers.
    - Yet, unlike a well-designed algorithm, the returns for the majority are disproportionately small.

    > Is this hierarchy an algorithm that’s failed to scale properly? Where is the optimization for the well-being of the collective, rather than just the top few nodes?

The existential nature of this question struck me hard today, like a bug in a program that surfaces only after the system has run for years—ignored, but now impossible to miss.
- I am left contemplating:

    > How do we rewrite the code of society to restore balance, ensuring that all parts of the system benefit rather than just the top?

*Well, enough of the somewhat thoughtful rant.*

Tons of philosophy or maybe rational stuff indeed—something everyone should think about. But my usual day began as it always does, grounded in the familiar: Maa and Baba, and waking up to some early *jap*, a ritual that centers me before the demands of the day take over.

*But what did I do today?*

- Covered my previous lectures on Caesar BGP, and the Networking papers by Shaikh and Goldberg. It’s fascinating how networking protocols evolve, mirroring the complexity of human interactions. In some ways, BGP, with its decisions based on local policies, feels like a metaphor for how humans function—each node acting in its own interest, yet somehow contributing to the larger global system.

- I also managed to complete HW2 for the course, using some networking tools like Linux traceroutes and others. These tools, much like compass points in a vast sea, offer clarity in tracking the pathways that data takes across the world. There’s something meditative about running traceroutes, observing how packets hop from server to server, tracing invisible routes that connect our fragmented digital world.

- Mangs was feeling better later in the day, so we decided to cook some quick comfort food together. Comfort food always has a way of bringing people together, and today's menu—garlic parmesan fettuccine with some fried paneer tikka—was no exception. A fusion of flavors, perhaps not the most conventional pairing, but sometimes the best moments come from the unplanned combinations. Just like life, right? You experiment, you blend, and sometimes, the unexpected ends up working.

- Later, I skimmed through some papers and proposals, a quieter task before sleep. There’s a certain calm in reading at night, where the world slows down, and you’re left alone with your thoughts and the pages in front of you.

- Throughout the day, I was intermittently in conversation with Maa and Baba, discussing the usual things—the little details that make up our daily lives. We also spoke a lot about the upcoming trips Baba has planned. His meticulous nature shows in the way he organizes every journey, ensuring that everything is just right. It's comforting to know that no matter how much time passes, some things remain constant. We also talked about the home renovations—our first major renovation after 25 years in the first tiny apartment we’ve called home. It’s funny how a house holds so much more than bricks and mortar; it’s the container of memories, of laughter, of arguments, of quiet moments. And now, as the walls change, the sense of continuity remains intact, grounded in the love that built this home in the first place.

**And so, the day ends with a thought: In a world where we continuously optimize our systems and algorithms, why do we struggle to optimize the structures of society itself?**

We live in an age where efficiency is everything. Algorithms drive our economies, our communications, our very way of interacting with the world. We relentlessly fine-tune them to extract the most value, reduce waste, and enhance performance. Yet, as we obsess over optimizing our machines, our networks, and our processes, we seem to fall short when it comes to optimizing the very structures that govern human lives.

Take, for instance, the way we design networks—every packet of data has a clear route, the fastest and most efficient way from point A to point B, avoiding congestion and failure points. But in our societal structures, where are the clear paths for people to move freely, without bottlenecks of inequality, discrimination, and power imbalances? If we can optimize traffic flows in a network, why can't we find ways to smooth out the flows of opportunity, access, and well-being in society?

Is it that we haven't yet found the right "protocol" for human fairness? Or is it that we lack the collective will to apply the same principles of efficiency and balance that we so easily deploy in code? In networking, every node is crucial, every connection vital to the overall function. Why, then, do we treat people like they are disposable in the grand architecture of society?

Perhaps the issue is that society is not built on rational rules like algorithms are. Human emotions, politics, and historical legacies complicate the process. But even so, shouldn't we be striving for a world where the system works for everyone, where inequality is not a feature but a bug that we actively seek to fix?

It’s a perplexing thought. As someone immersed in the world of networks and optimization, it feels almost hypocritical that we allow such inefficiencies in the way we structure our societies.

*Could we, one day, design a society that functions as smoothly as our most optimized algorithms? Or are we doomed to live with the inefficiencies of human hierarchies forever?*
