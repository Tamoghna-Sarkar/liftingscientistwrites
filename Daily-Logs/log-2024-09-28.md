# Daily Log - 28th September 2024

Today started with a lingering thought, one that had been quietly creeping into my consciousness:

*Is it like, just like code, algorithms, and many other constructs, that hierarchical ordering is important for balance in human society?*

If so, why does this hierarchy seem to tilt so sharply, with the majority of people languishing in the lower tiers while only a select few enjoy the privileges at the top?

- When we write code, the structure is paramount—there’s an order, a clear delineation of how functions, classes, and modules interact with one another.
    - Every layer has its purpose, its function, and the system thrives when balance is maintained.
    - When one part of the system overreaches or underperforms, the program becomes inefficient or crashes altogether.
  
- The same principle appears in nature: ecosystems are delicate balances of hierarchy, where every organism has a role.
    - From apex predators to the tiniest microbes, there’s an invisible code that keeps the system alive.
    - And yet, in human society, this balance seems to fray at the edges.
    - The hierarchy is skewed, leaving vast majorities at the bottom, working tirelessly to support those perched at the top.

    > Is this really a balance, or is it a distortion of the natural order?

*This imbalance poses a critical question:*

- *Why does the lower tier remain so large, and how does this skewed distribution sustain itself over time?*
    - Is it by design, or is it a failure of collective will?

When I reflect on how algorithms operate, how data structures ensure efficiency, I wonder if a similar model could apply to societal structures.
- But algorithms work because they are built to be optimized—they follow rules and are engineered for a purpose.
- In contrast, human hierarchies often seem less purposeful and more driven by ambition, greed, or perhaps simply by inertia.

Take capitalism as a code, for instance. 
- The top tier grows exponentially, feeding on resources and labor from the lower tiers.
    - Yet, unlike a well-designed algorithm, the returns for the majority are disproportionately small.

    > Is this hierarchy an algorithm that’s failed to scale properly? Where is the optimization for the well-being of the collective, rather than just the top few nodes?

The existential nature of this question struck me hard today, like a bug in a program that surfaces only after the system has run for years—ignored, but now impossible to miss.
- I am left contemplating:

    > How do we rewrite the code of society to restore balance, ensuring that all parts of the system benefit rather than just the top?

*Well, enough of the somewhat thoughtful rant*

Tons of philosophy or maybe rational stuff indeed—something everyone should think about. 

But my usual day started with Maa Baba and waking up to some early *jap*. 

*But what did I do today?*

- Covered my previous lectures on Caesar BGP, and the Networking papers by Shaikh and Goldberg.
- Completed HW2 for the course using some networking tools like Linux traceroutes and others.
- Mangs was feeling good towards the later part of the day, so we decided to cook some quick comfort food together: garlic parmesan fettuccine with some fried paneer tikka (not necessarily the best combination, but why not?).
- Skimmed through some papers and proposals while lying down before sleep.
- Intermittently talked to Maa Baba throughout the day about every little detail. We also discussed upcoming trips Baba has planned and the ongoing renovation work at home—work that began after 25 years in the first tiny apartment we’ve called home.

**And so, the day ends with a thought: In a world where we continuously optimize our systems and algorithms, why do we struggle to optimize the structures of society itself?**
