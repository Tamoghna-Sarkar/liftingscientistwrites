# Daily Log - 28th September 2024

Today started with a lingering thought, one that had been quietly creeping into my consciousness:

*Is it like, just like code, algorithms, and many other constructs, that hierarchical ordering is important for balance in human society?*

If so, why does this hierarchy seem to tilt so sharply, with the majority of people languishing in the lower tiers while only a select few enjoy the privileges at the top?

- When we write code, the structure is paramount—there’s an order, a clear delineation of how functions, classes, and modules interact with one another.
    - Every layer has its purpose, its function, and the system thrives when balance is maintained.
    - When one part of the system overreaches or underperforms, the program becomes inefficient or crashes altogether.
  
- The same principle appears in nature: ecosystems are delicate balances of hierarchy, where every organism has a role.
    - From apex predators to the tiniest microbes, there’s an invisible code that keeps the system alive.
    - And yet, in human society, this balance seems to fray at the edges.
    - The hierarchy is skewed, leaving vast majorities at the bottom, working tirelessly to support those perched at the top.

    > Is this really a balance, or is it a distortion of the natural order?

*This imbalance poses a critical question:*

- *Why does the lower tier remain so large, and how does this skewed distribution sustain itself over time?*
    - Is it by design, or is it a failure of collective will?

When I reflect on how algorithms operate, how data structures ensure efficiency, I wonder if a similar model could apply to societal structures.
- But algorithms work because they are built to be optimized—they follow rules and are engineered for a purpose.
- In contrast, human hierarchies often seem less purposeful and more driven by ambition, greed, or perhaps simply by inertia.

Take capitalism as a code, for instance. 
- The top tier grows exponentially, feeding on resources and labor from the lower tiers.
    - Yet, unlike a well-designed algorithm, the returns for the majority are disproportionately small.

    > Is this hierarchy an algorithm that’s failed to scale properly? Where is the optimization for the well-being of the collective, rather than just the top few nodes?

The existential nature of this question struck me hard today, like a bug in a program that surfaces only after the system has run for years—ignored, but now impossible to miss.
- I am left contemplating:

    > How do we rewrite the code of society to restore balance, ensuring that all parts of the system benefit rather than just the top?
